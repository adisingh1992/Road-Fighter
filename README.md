# Road-Fighter
A C-graphics based obstacle manoeuvring game.

This was started as a fun-project when i started learning graphics in c programming.

The game allows a player to manoeuvre oncoming road-traffic. The player's car has 5-speed modes,
the last of which could only be accessed for five seconds.

**Features To Be Added In Future**
  => A points system.
  => Different levels based on points and obstacles.
  => A much cleaner layout.
